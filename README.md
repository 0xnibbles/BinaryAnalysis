# Binary Analysis

Messing a little bit with linux binaries and learning how at the low level things work.
All the stuff here is made with the purpose to prepare myself for binary exploitation.

## Why binary Analysis?

It's the art of analyzing binaries more specifically their properties, machine code and the data they have.
Also, it's a challeging field because generally there is no symbolic information, no type information, no high level abstraction and data can be mixed with code.
